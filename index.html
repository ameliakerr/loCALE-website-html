    <h1>The LoCALE Project</h1>

        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>The Local Crime and Law Enforcement Project (LoCALE) is a national database compiling micro-level arrest, incident, and dispatch records from thousands of cities across the United States. Designed for researchers and policymakers, LoCALE provides a more comprehensive and granular view of public safety activity than existing crime data sources.</p>
        <p>Current crime datasets face significant limitations: coverage is often restricted to select jurisdictions, data rarely extends below the city level, low-level offenses such as theft are frequently excluded, offender characteristics are limited, and there is no centralized source for dispatch data. These gaps constrain rigorous research and evidence-based policymaking.</p>
        <p>LoCALE addresses these shortcomings by expanding geographic coverage to the census tract level, incorporating both high- and low-level offenses, and including richer information on offender characteristics. It is also the first centralized source for dispatch data across jurisdictions, enabling new lines of inquiry into law enforcement response.</p>
        <p>By integrating arrest, incident, and dispatch records into a unified framework, LoCALE aims to support more precise measurement, deeper analysis, and more informed public policy.</p>
